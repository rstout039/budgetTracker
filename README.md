# budgetTracker
This is a Progressive Web App that lets a user track and manage their budget and finances.<br>
This app uses the following packages:<br>
Mongoose<br>
Morgan<br>
Lite-server<br>
express<br>
compression<br>
This app lets the user track their budget when connected to the internet as well as when they are offline.<br>
The user balance will be displayed at the top of the webpage.<br>
The user can choose whether to add money to their budget and can subtract their budget too.<br>
The user will enter data into the page with the amount of the item and the app will store it into a database.<br>
That database will then return a value for the data and store it on the page under the total amount.<br>
The user will also get to view a line chart of their budget history to track the cost of their items.<br>
This app uses a MONGODB database and is deployed on HEROKU.<br>
